Piet Goddaer. This musician from Kortrijk, son of celebrated classical composer Norbert Goddaer, was the singer/rapper of the group Word before Ozark Henry. Despite a lot of gigs, the group never managed to get a record deal (the only release is a track "Henry Men-She" on "Debuutrock 1995") and died a subsequent silent death. At home in his living room, Goddaer and his friend Filip Tanghe, were also busy fiddling with computers and synthesizers. A few of these experiments landed on the table of record firm Method (Double T) that offered the group a contract.
